Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either row-based or column-based, making it ideal for aligning items along a single axis, such as in navigation bars, or for distributing space between elements. 
CSS Grid, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for both rows and columns, which gives you more control over the overall structure of complex layouts, such as entire web pages. 
While both tools offer flexibility, support for responsive design, and modern approaches to layout, Flexbox becomes more useful when managing content along a single axis, while Grid is better suited for handling more intricate designs that require control over multiple axes.
