1. JavaScript is a programming language used for web development, enabling dynamic content and interactivity. An interpreted language like JavaScript is executed line-by-line at runtime, while a compiled language, such as C++, is converted into machine code before running, which usually makes it faster but less flexible during development.
2. Dynamically typed languages like JavaScript allow variables to change types at runtime, while statically typed languages like java require fixed types at compile time. Strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, whereas weakly typed languages allow type conversions more freely, sometimes leading to unpredictable results.
3. var is function-scoped and can be re-declared, leading to possible issues. let is block-scoped and can be reassigned but not re-declared. const is also block-scoped but cannot be reassigned, making it ideal for constants, though objects and arrays declared with const can still have their contents modified.
4. Anonymous functions are unnamed functions often used as arguments. Higher-order functions either take or return other functions. Callback functions are passed to other functions to be executed later. First-class functions mean functions can be treated like any other valueâ€”assigned to variables, passed around, or returned by other functions.
5. Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs used to store data and functionality. Each key (property) is associated with a value, which can be any data type. Objects help organize data and methods, making them essential for modeling real-world entities and structuring code.
