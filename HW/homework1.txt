1. What is HTML? What does it do?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, essentially building the skeleton of a webpage.

2. What is CSS? What does it do?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design HTML elements. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a website, making it look more appealing and user-friendly.

4. What is an HTML element? Tag? Attribute?
An HTML element is the building block of a webpage, consisting of a start tag, content, and an end tag. A tag is part of an element, usually enclosed in angle brackets, that marks the beginning (<h1>) and end (</h1>) of the content. 
An attribute provides extra information about an element, placed inside the start tag. For example, src and alt in html code could be viewed as  attributes that define the image source and alternative text.

5. What are the parts of a CSS rule?
A CSS rule is made up of three main parts: the selector, the property, and the value. The selector targets the HTML element to style.
The property defines the specific style aspect to change, like color, font-size, or margin. 
The value specifies the setting for that property, such as color: red; or font-size: 16px;.

6. Explain how CSS rules cascade.
CSS rules cascade based on three main principles: inheritance, specificity, and source order. Inheritance means some properties (like font size or color) are passed from parent to child elements. 
Specificity determines which rule applies when multiple rules target the same element; more specific selectors override less specific ones. 
Source order means that when rules have equal specificity, the one written last in the CSS overrides earlier ones. 

7. If you have a directory called project-1 that contains two subdirectories, html-files and images. In the html-files directory you have an HTML file called html-1.html that has an img element with a src attribute, write out the value of the src attribute to access an image file called pinecone.jpg in the images directory.
<img src="../images/pinecone.jpg" alt="Pinecone Image">

8. What is the default behavior when submitting a HTML form?
When you submit an HTML form, it sends the form data to the URL in the `action` attribute using the method defined in `method` (usually "GET" or "POST"). By default, "GET" appends data to the URL, while "POST" sends it in the request body. If no `action` is specified, it sends the data to the current page URL. After submission, the page reloads or navigates to a new one.
